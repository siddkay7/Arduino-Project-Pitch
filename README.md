# Arduino-Project-Pitch
Arduino Project Pitch- An integrated device consisting of a speed gun and a Breathalyzer.

Problem Statement :
Inability of policemen to manage and record crimes easily and use technology. 

Solution:
I have made an integrated device which can act as both a Speed Gun as well as a Breathalyzer. The components I have used are : 
Ultrasonic sensor(for Speed gun), an IR blaster (for Breathalyzer which is actually a modified IR spectrometer), a bluetooth HC-05 device, led. and an arduino. When Overspeed or Alcohol is detected, a message is sent to the phone which in turn can be directly recorded and an LED turns on. Therefore it serves a dual purpose and is also linked to a mobile device. Thus data is recorded.
